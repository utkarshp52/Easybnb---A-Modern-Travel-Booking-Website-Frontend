Easybnb - A Modern Travel Booking Website Frontend
A feature-rich, responsive front-end project designed to replicate the user interface and experience of a modern travel booking platform. This project showcases a range of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing user experience.

A core concept of the design is the exclusive use of AI-generated imagery, demonstrating a futuristic approach to web content.

‚ú® Key Features
This project is built from the ground up and includes a wide array of modern web features:

üé® Design & User Experience
Fully Responsive Design: Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

Dark / Light Theme: A persistent, toggleable dark mode that saves the user's preference in their browser (localStorage).

Smart "Auto-Hiding" Navigation: The navbar slides out of view when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up, maximizing screen real estate.

Smooth Scroll Animations: Elements gracefully fade in as the user scrolls down the page using the Intersection Observer API.

Interactive Hover Effects: Professional CSS animations on cards (lift & shadow) and images (zoom) provide satisfying visual feedback.

Image Lightbox: A gallery modal allows users to view destination images in a larger format.

"Back to Top" Button: A convenient utility for easily navigating long pages.

‚öôÔ∏è Interactive JavaScript Functionality
Client-Side Form Validation: The registration and search forms have robust validation to ensure data integrity before submission.

Interactive Listing Filters: On the "Popular Places" page, users can filter properties in real-time by amenities (checkboxes) and price (a range slider).

Local Storage Persistence: The application cleverly uses localStorage to simulate a persistent state for:

The user's dark/light mode preference.

Storing registration data (as a prototype for backend functionality).

Dropdown Menus: Clean, CSS-driven dropdown menus for improved navigation.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This is a pure front-end project, built with vanilla technologies (no frameworks).

HTML5: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.

CSS3: Advanced styling using Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties (Variables) for theming, and complex animations/transitions.

JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript for all interactivity, DOM manipulation, form validation, and managing browser storage.

üöÄ How to Run Locally
To run this project on your local machine:

Clone the repository:

Bash

Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd easybnb-project
Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser.

üîÆ Future Improvements
While this is a complete front-end project, the logical next step is to build a full-stack application. This would involve:

Backend Development: Creating a server using a technology like Node.js (Express) or Python (Django).

Database Integration: Using a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store real user data, listings, and bookings.

API Development: Building a REST or GraphQL API to allow the front-end and back-end to communicate.

User Authentication: Implementing a secure login/logout system with password hashing.
